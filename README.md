                                                  LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

  The library is the place where we find a collection of books organized in a particular order. In the library,  we can collect book read them, and then return it. But, Managing a particular library is not an easy task. So, we can create a C language-based application using if-else statements, arrays, strings, switch cases, etc. Using this application we can easily manage the books in the library, we can get information about books, etc.
  
  The system includes functionalities for the admin to add, view, modify, and delete book records. It also has a login system to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and manage the records.
